#1 - sort greedy
#2 - hashmap pair sum noticing powers of 2 there are only 32 of them
#3 - binary search on prefix and sufix sum to split array into three increasing
#4 - dp noticing that because one of the strings are distinct, we can use the 2nd string to make a third string of indices of the first string if 2nd string contains a letter. Then, we want to find the longest increasing subsequence in nlogn time and then subtract that from 1st string
